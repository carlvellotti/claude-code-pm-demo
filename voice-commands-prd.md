**Document Status:** Draft  
**Last Updated:** September 2025  
**Author:** Technical Product Team  
**Stakeholders:** Engineering, AI/ML Team, Security, Customer Success

## Executive Summary

Implementation of a voice-activated command interface powered by OpenAI's GPT Realtime API to enable hands-free workflow automation and reduce onboarding friction from 45 days to under 14 days. The system shall provide low-latency voice interaction for workflow creation, modification, and execution within the StreamlineAI platform.

## Problem Statement

### Customer Pain Points
Current StreamlineAI interface requires extensive GUI interaction and workflow creation knowledge, creating barriers for:
- Field service teams requiring hands-free operation during active work
- Users with accessibility needs who struggle with complex visual interfaces  
- Non-technical users intimidated by visual workflow builders
- Mobile users limited by small screen real estate for complex operations

### Quantified Impact
- **Onboarding Friction:** Average 45-day time-to-value primarily due to workflow creation complexity
- **Feature Adoption:** 70% of platform capabilities remain unused due to discovery barriers
- **Mobile Limitations:** 40% of TAM (field service segment) cannot effectively use current interface
- **Support Burden:** 35% of tickets related to "how to create workflows" questions

### Technical Evidence
- Competitor analysis shows 60% faster workflow creation with voice interfaces
- Internal user testing demonstrates 3x faster task completion with voice commands
- Customer interviews indicate 85% interest in voice-activated workflow management

## Technical Objectives

### Performance Requirements
- **Latency:** <200ms response time for voice command acknowledgment (p99)
- **Accuracy:** >95% speech recognition accuracy for domain-specific terminology
- **Throughput:** Support 1,000 concurrent voice sessions with auto-scaling
- **Availability:** 99.9% uptime SLA with graceful degradation to text interface

### Security Requirements
- Audio data shall be encrypted in transit using TLS 1.3
- Voice samples must not be stored beyond session duration (ephemeral processing)
- Authentication via existing OAuth 2.0 + biometric verification for voice activation
- Enterprise data residency compliance (EU/US regions as configured)
