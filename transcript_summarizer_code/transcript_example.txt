00:00:00.190 ## This Video Will Hurt
00:00:01.190 Please, put on your headphones -- I promise that there won't be any loud sounds, but this
00:00:04.610 video is going to hurt.
00:00:06.529 There's a study about hypersounds and how they cause headaches: these sounds are too
00:00:10.150 high-pitched to hear -- like the one added to this video, playing right now -- but cause
00:00:15.139 headaches they still do.
00:00:16.710 The hypersound in your headphones is pressing on your inner ear, stressing the nerves leading
00:00:20.950 to your brain where, if the headache hasn't started already, it soon will as exposure
00:00:25.880 causes headaches after only ten seconds.
00:00:28.700 Oh my.
00:00:29.700 Can you feel it?
00:00:30.700 That pressure on your ears spreading to your now throbbing brain?
00:00:33.399 Because...
00:00:34.399 ...you shouldn't: the study is made up and there's no hypersound in the audio, but still
00:00:38.120 some of you will have began to feel a headache.
00:00:40.640 Why?
00:00:41.640 The nocebo effect.
00:00:42.640 A nocebo is a harmless thing -- like a video with nonexistent hypersounds -- that causes
00:00:46.600 harm -- like a headache -- because you *believe* it's harmful.
00:00:49.850 That sounds like Voodoo, but there's science behind the nocebo effect, which is more than
00:00:54.020 an irritating parlor trick, it causes real problems like in medicine.
00:00:58.319 When testing a new drug doctors get a group of sick people give half of them the new drug
00:01:02.111 and give the other have a fake pill that does nothing -- but which they're told is real.
00:01:06.780 This is how science finds the stuff that works amongst the junk that doesn't.
00:01:10.600 But new drugs have side effects and sometimes patients drop out of the experiment because
00:01:14.500 of them.
00:01:15.500 No surprise there.
00:01:16.610 But some people on the fake *also* drop out from the side effects.
00:01:20.620 Side effects they've gotten from a drug they *aren't* taking.
00:01:23.180 But because they *think* they're on the real thing, they've also *thought* themselves into
00:01:26.920 the side effects.
00:01:28.250 Now maybe this is just a case of misattribution: people get headaches and, if they're joined
00:01:31.880 a drug trial that lists headaches in the side effects, it's natural to blame the new drug
00:01:35.741 -- and that certainly happens to some extent.
00:01:38.320 But the nocebo effects is more than just misattribution, it causes real, additional harm that scientists
00:01:43.390 can measure in cruel, cruel experiments -- and this is one of the reasons there not an over
00:01:48.110 abundance of research on nocoboes: approach your friendly neighborhood ethics board with
00:01:51.960 an experiment designed to hurt people and they'll frown on that.
00:01:55.530 But sometimes nocebo experiments do get approved to the benefit of science and humanity, if
00:01:59.710 not the participants.
00:02:00.880 For example, under the right conditions some people who expect a harmless injection will
00:02:04.320 give them a rash will get a rash, but for people who expect nothing to happen, nothing
00:02:08.479 is exactly what happens.
00:02:10.380 And fake pills can be additive: take test subjects off pills they believe are addictive
00:02:14.470 and some will experience nocebic withdrawal symptoms -- like pain and fatigue -- from
00:02:18.980 the pills that they could never have been addicted to in the first place.
00:02:22.450 Another experiment gave people harmless injections, told half of them to just sit there and told
00:02:26.060 the other half that their pain would increase for the next thirty minutes -- which it did.
00:02:30.310 But in this situation there is a drug that can block the nocebo effect and those who
00:02:34.200 were told the injection would hurt, but were also secretly given the nocebo-blocking drug
00:02:39.050 did *not* report an increase in pain -- showing that the nocebo effect is a real, physical
00:02:43.870 process.
00:02:44.870 In all these nocebo experiments it's the belief in harm that matters.
00:02:48.050 If someone dressed as a voodoo witch doctor popped up and hexed you with a curse of great
00:02:51.630 pain -- no effect.
00:02:53.060 But, in a room with a real doctor and his clipboard and a big science machine and a
00:02:57.069 needle in your arm, you'll take his words rather more seriously.
00:03:00.480 Which is why doctors say: "This won't hurt a bit" rather than "Oh this?
00:03:04.430 It's going to hurt.
00:03:05.530 Like *a lot*." -- which, by the way, was a real experiment done on women undergoing labor
00:03:10.069 during spinal injections.
00:03:12.320 Guess how that turned out?
00:03:13.580 But nocebos don't end here.
00:03:15.240 While illnesses like the flu, spread from contact with disgusting, germ-infected humans
00:03:19.230 and the things they touch with their, disgusting germy hands -- a nocebo spreads from mind
00:03:24.000 to mind, no contact required.
00:03:25.920 A notable example happened in a Tennessee high school.
00:03:28.819 One teacher reported a strange smell in her classroom and developed symptoms of headache
00:03:32.620 nausea, and difficulty breathing.
00:03:34.600 These symptoms spread to some of her students and from them to others in the school.
00:03:38.880 Almost two hundred people ended up at the local hospital but all medical tests came
00:03:43.069 back with nothing, nor was anything harmful found at the school.
00:03:46.819 This was a nocebo -- the belief that the air was making them sick -- spread mind to mind.
00:03:52.599 Everyone who got sick heard about the symptoms from someone else.
00:03:56.310 When this happens, it's called mass psychogenic illness.
00:03:59.600 The treatment in these cases is to separate those with symptoms from the rest and reassure
00:04:03.750 the ill that yes, their symptoms are real, but no they haven't been exposed to anything
00:04:08.230 toxic, and yes people are getting better quickly:
00:04:10.860 The last is one of the indicators that separates a real poison gas leak or biological weapon
00:04:15.680 from mass psychogenic illness.
00:04:17.470 But the final factor, number of cases increasing with greater media coverage, can lead to this
00:04:21.760 kind of thing spreading far and wide.
00:04:24.199 Take, electrosensitives: people who get nausea (among other things) from exposure to parts
00:04:28.630 of the electromagnetic spectrum, notably WiFi the density of which is increasing over time,
00:04:34.040 forcing particularly bad sufferers to retreat to places like the creepy-sounding radio science
00:04:38.800 zone in, where else, West Virginia.
00:04:41.380 But put electrosensitives in a room with a WiFi router and they can't actually tell via
00:04:45.750 their symptoms if it's on or off.
00:04:48.220 Instead their symptoms track with being told if it's on or off.
00:04:52.180 And if you make a group of people without electrosensitivity watch a news report on
00:04:55.690 how Wifi makes you ill while another group watches something uninformative and afterward
00:05:00.100 expose both groups to a fake Wifi signal only some of those who watched the news report
00:05:04.631 feel sick.
00:05:05.700 There's a similar phenomenon called 'wind farm disease' with similar side effects, which
00:05:09.170 turns up where it's been talked about on the local news, but not in other places in the
00:05:13.430 same country with the same wind farms where it isn't.
00:05:16.520 All this makes it too easy to mock people for thinking they're getting sick from WiFi
00:05:20.290 or Wind farms or *Wind farms with WiFi* -- but it's important to realize they're not crazy,
00:05:25.380 the side effects are real, they're just wrong about the source: all evidence points to the
00:05:30.020 belief in electrosensitivy as the cause of electrosensitivity.
00:05:34.350 Which means the news reports talking about these illnesses are spreading a kind of mind
00:05:38.100 virus.
00:05:39.100 And while these are exotic examples, there is also evidence that some allergies and asthma
00:05:43.080 cases are nocebic and thus able to be spread in the same way.
00:05:47.030 To be clear: if someone's having an asthma attack, that's not the time to tell them you
00:05:50.830 know they're being a drama llama because you watched an Internet video about the nocebo
00:05:55.310 effect.
00:05:56.310 *They're really having an asthma attack* and they *really* need something to make it stop
00:05:59.790 and that's *really* not you showing off your knowledge.
00:06:03.260 Harmful things aren't harmful just because we believe they are -- the right dose of arsenic
00:06:07.290 will kill you as surely as an anvil to the head, no matter your insistence otherwise.
00:06:11.880 But the nocebo effect does show that our beliefs about otherwise harmless things can make them
00:06:16.449 harmful.
00:06:17.449 Which means that our voodoo doctor's hex from before really could work, but only if you
00:06:21.180 were foolish enough to believe him.
