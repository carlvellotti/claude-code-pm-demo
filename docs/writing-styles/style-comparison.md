# Style Comparison and Guidelines

## Style Comparison Table

| Aspect | Technical | User-Friendly | Internal-Audience |
|--------|-----------|---------------|-------------------|
| **Audience** | Engineers, architects | End users, customers | Internal teams |
| **Tone** | Formal, precise | Conversational, warm | Direct, professional |
| **Detail Level** | Very high | Moderate | High but selective |
| **Jargon Usage** | Heavy | Minimal | Moderate |
| **Focus** | How it works | What you can do | Why we're doing it |
| **Metrics** | Technical KPIs | User benefits | Business impact |

## Switching Between Styles

When transitioning between styles, consider:
1. **Audience needs** - What does your reader need to know?
2. **Action required** - What should they do with this information?
3. **Context level** - How much background do they have?
4. **Emotional tone** - Should this inspire, inform, or direct?

## Quick Style Converter Examples

**Technical → User-Friendly**
- "API rate limiting at 1000 QPM" → "Can handle all your team's requests without slowdowns"
- "OAuth 2.0 integration" → "Secure sign-in using your existing accounts"

**User-Friendly → Internal-Audience**
- "Save hours each week" → "Reduces operational overhead by 15% (per CS team metrics)"
- "Easy to get started" → "2-week implementation timeline using standard deployment playbook"

**Internal-Audience → Technical**
- "Mobile expansion initiative" → "React Native implementation with offline-first architecture"
- "Customer-requested feature" → "Requirements traced to tickets #1234, #1235, #1236"
