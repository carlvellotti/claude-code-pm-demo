- Technical PRDs for engineering teams

## Example
"The authentication service shall implement OAuth 2.0 with PKCE flow, supporting refresh token rotation with a 24-hour TTL. The service must handle 10,000 concurrent auth requests with p99 latency under 200ms. Integration requires webhook endpoints for event propagation using HMAC-SHA256 signature verification."
