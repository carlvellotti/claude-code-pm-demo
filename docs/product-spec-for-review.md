# Product Specification: Smart Notification System

**Version:** 1.2  
**Last Updated:** January 2025  
**Status:** Ready for Review

## Overview

The Smart Notification System will use machine learning to optimize when and how users receive notifications from StreamlineAI, reducing notification fatigue while ensuring critical alerts are never missed.

## Core Functionality

### Intelligent Timing
The system will analyze user behavior patterns to determine optimal notification delivery times:
- Track when users typically engage with notifications
- Batch non-urgent notifications for convenient delivery windows
- Respect timezone and working hours preferences
- Emergency notifications bypass all timing rules

### Channel Optimization
Automatically route notifications to the most effective channel:
- Email for detailed updates and reports
- SMS for urgent action items
- In-app for workflow status updates
- Slack/Teams for collaborative notifications

### Smart Grouping
Related notifications will be intelligently bundled:
- Combine multiple workflow completions into single summary
- Group similar error messages with resolution steps
- Aggregate approval requests from same process
- Maintain separate streams for different projects

## User Configuration

### Preference Center
Users can customize their notification experience:
- Set quiet hours (no notifications except emergencies)
- Choose preferred channels by notification type
- Define what constitutes "urgent" for their role
- Preview notification appearance across channels

### Learning Mode
The system improves over time:
- First 2 weeks: Learn user patterns
- Weeks 3-4: Start optimizing delivery
- Month 2+: Full optimization active
- Continuous learning with seasonal adjustments

## Technical Implementation

### ML Model
- Input features: engagement history, role, timezone, workflow types
- Output: optimal time window and channel selection
- Training data: 6 months of notification engagement data
- Model refresh: Weekly retraining with new data

### Performance Requirements
- Notification delivery latency: <500ms
- Channel failover time: <2 seconds
- Preference update propagation: <10 seconds
- Support for 100k concurrent users

### Integration Points
- Current notification service (deprecate after migration)
- Email service provider (SendGrid)
- SMS gateway (Twilio)
- Collaboration tools (Slack, Teams APIs)

## Success Metrics

### Primary KPIs
- Notification engagement rate: >65% (from current 42%)
- User-reported notification fatigue: <20% (from 67%)
- Critical notification response time: <5 minutes (from 12)

### Secondary Metrics
- Unsubscribe rate: <5%
- Channel preference adoption: >80%
- Positive feedback ratio: >4:1

## Rollout Plan

### Phase 1: Foundation (Week 1-4)
- Build preference center UI
- Implement basic channel routing
- Create engagement tracking

### Phase 2: Learning (Week 5-8)
- Deploy ML model in shadow mode
- Collect training data
- A/B test with 10% of users

### Phase 3: Launch (Week 9-12)
- Gradual rollout to all users
- Monitor metrics closely
- Iterate based on feedback

## Risks and Considerations

### Technical Risks
- ML model accuracy may be low initially
- Channel API rate limits could impact delivery
- Data privacy concerns with behavior tracking

### User Experience Risks
- Change management for existing notification habits
- Potential to miss notifications during learning phase
- Complexity of preference configuration

### Mitigation Strategies
- Extensive QA with diverse user personas
- Gradual rollout with easy rollback
- Clear communication about benefits
- Simple "reset to defaults" option

## Open Questions

1. Should we include desktop push notifications as a channel?
2. How do we handle notifications for users who rarely engage?
3. Should team admins be able to set organization-wide defaults?
4. Do we need different models for different industries?
5. How do we balance personalization with predictability?

## Dependencies

- Data warehouse upgrade (in progress)
- User consent for behavioral tracking (legal review needed)
- Slack/Teams app approval (submitted)
- SMS budget approval (pending finance)

## Appendix

### A. Competitive Analysis
- Competitor X: Basic time-zone awareness only
- Competitor Y: Channel selection but no ML optimization  
- Competitor Z: Similar features but poor user experience

### B. User Research Summary
- 87% of users report notification overload
- Top request: "Only notify me when it matters"
- Preferred channels vary significantly by role
