**Author:** Lisa Park, PM  
**Stakeholders:** Design, Engineering, Sales, Marketing

## Overview

Creating pre-built workflow templates for specific industries to reduce time-to-value from 45 days to under 7 days for new customers.

## Problem & Opportunity

### Current State Problems
- New customers take 45 days average to see value
- 65% of trials abandon before creating first workflow  
- "Blank canvas" problem overwhelms new users

### Market Opportunity  
- Competitors charge $5-10k for industry templates
- Sales requesting templates for 73% of deals
- Would unblock $4.2M in pipeline

## User Research Insights

From 25 customer interviews:
- "I want to see what others in my industry are doing" (18/25)
- "Starting from scratch is intimidating" (21/25)  
- "I need to prove value quickly to my boss" (15/25)

Common first workflows by industry:
- **Healthcare**: Patient intake → scheduling → follow-up
- **Manufacturing**: Quality check → issue escalation → resolution
- **Retail**: Inventory alert → reorder → confirmation
- **Finance**: Document collection → review → approval
