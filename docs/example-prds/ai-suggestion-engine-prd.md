# PRD: AI Workflow Suggestion Engine

**Author:** Marcus Thompson, Principal PM  
**Status:** Ready for Review

## Executive Summary
AI-powered engine that suggests workflow optimizations, targeting 30% efficiency improvement and reducing support tickets.

## Problem
- Users waste 2-3 hours/week on inefficient workflows
- Only 30% discover optimization features naturally
- 45% of support tickets ask "how to improve"

## Solution
### Core Features
1. **Pattern Recognition**: Analyze workflows to find inefficiencies
2. **Smart Suggestions**: "Combine steps 3 & 4 to save 5 min"
3. **Impact Preview**: Show time savings before implementing

### User Flow
1. See suggestion in dashboard
2. Review impact metrics
3. Preview in sandbox
4. Apply with one click
5. Track improvements

## Success Metrics
- Suggestion acceptance >25%
- Workflow time reduction -30%
- Support tickets -25%

## Technical Approach
- ML ensemble model
- Real-time analytics (Kafka/Spark)
- Privacy-first: anonymized data only

## Investment
- 6 engineers for 6 months
- $23k/month infrastructure

## Launch Plan
1. Internal beta (4 weeks)
2. Customer beta (8 weeks)
3. GA rollout

## Key Risks
- **Data quality**: Start with rules, add ML gradually
- **User control**: Make suggestions dismissible
- **Scale**: Plan for caching strategy
