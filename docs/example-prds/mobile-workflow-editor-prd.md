# PRD: Mobile Workflow Editor

**Document Status:** Draft  
**Last Updated:** January 2025  
**Author:** Sarah Chen, Senior PM  
**Stakeholders:** Engineering, Design, Sales, Customer Success

## Executive Summary

We are building a mobile-first workflow editor to enable field workers to create and modify automation workflows directly from their mobile devices. This addresses a critical gap preventing 40% of our addressable market from fully utilizing StreamlineAI.

## Problem Statement

### Customer Problem
Field service teams and mobile workers cannot access StreamlineAI's workflow capabilities outside the office, forcing them to either:
- Delay process updates until returning to a desktop
- Call office staff to make changes on their behalf  
- Use competing mobile-native solutions

### Business Impact
- **Lost Revenue:** $2.4M ARR from deals lost to mobile-first competitors
- **Churn Risk:** 12 enterprise accounts cited lack of mobile as renewal concern
- **Market Limitation:** Cannot address 40% of TAM (field service segment)

### Evidence
- 68% of support tickets from mobile users requesting editor access
- User interviews: "I need to update workflows on-site when I discover process issues"
- Competitor analysis: 3 of 5 main competitors offer mobile editing

## Goals & Success Metrics

### Primary Goals
1. Enable workflow creation and editing on mobile devices
2. Maintain feature parity for core workflow operations
3. Achieve sub-3-second load times on 4G networks

### Success Metrics
- **Adoption:** 50% of mobile users create/edit a workflow within 30 days
- **Engagement:** Mobile-created workflows have >80% completion rate
- **Performance:** Page load time <3s on 4G (p90)
- **Business:** Win 10 field service deals in Q2 2025

## User Stories

### Must Have (P0)
- As a field technician, I can create a new workflow from mobile
- As a mobile user, I can edit existing workflow steps
- As a supervisor, I can approve workflow changes from my phone

### Should Have (P1)
- As a mobile user, I can test workflows before publishing
- As a field worker, I can use voice input for workflow descriptions
- As a mobile user, I can access workflow templates

### Nice to Have (P2)
- As a user, I can collaborate on workflows in real-time
- As an admin, I can set mobile-specific permissions

## Solution Overview

### Approach
Progressive web app (PWA) using existing React codebase with mobile-optimized components. Offline-first architecture with automatic sync.

### Key Features
1. **Touch-Optimized Editor**: Drag-drop interface designed for fingers
2. **Offline Mode**: Full functionality without connection, syncs when online
3. **Quick Actions**: Common workflow patterns as one-tap templates
4. **Voice Input**: Describe workflows verbally, AI converts to steps

### Out of Scope
- Native mobile apps (PWA only for v1)
- Advanced analytics features
- Admin configuration panels

## Technical Requirements

### Performance
- Initial load: <3s on 4G
- Offline capability with 50MB local storage
- Support for workflows up to 100 steps

### Compatibility
- iOS 14+ (Safari, Chrome)
- Android 8+ (Chrome, Samsung Internet)
- Responsive design 320px - 768px

### Security
- Biometric authentication support
- Encrypted local storage
- Session timeout after 15 min inactive

## Timeline & Milestones

### Phase 1: Foundation (6 weeks)
- Mobile component library
- Offline sync infrastructure
- Basic workflow CRUD operations

### Phase 2: Editor (8 weeks)
- Touch-optimized workflow builder
- Template system
- Voice input integration

### Phase 3: Polish & Launch (4 weeks)
- Performance optimization
- User testing & iteration
- Go-to-market preparation

**Target Launch:** May 2025

## Risks & Mitigations

| Risk | Impact | Probability | Mitigation |
|------|---------|-------------|------------|
| Performance issues on older devices | High | Medium | Set minimum device requirements, provide lite mode |
| Complex workflows hard to edit on small screens | Medium | High | Focus on simple workflows, desktop handoff for complex |
| Offline sync conflicts | Medium | Medium | Clear conflict resolution UI, audit trail |
