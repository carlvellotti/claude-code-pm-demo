## Interview Transcript

**Interviewer:** Marcus, thanks for taking the time. Can you start by telling us about RetailFlow and your role?

**Marcus:** We're a mid-size retail chain, about 150 stores across the West Coast. I oversee operations, which means everything from inventory management to employee scheduling. We've been StreamlineAI customers for about a year.

**Interviewer:** What made you choose StreamlineAI?

**Marcus:** We were drowning in manual processes. Every store had its own way of doing things. Inventory counts in spreadsheets, employee requests via email, supplier orders through three different systems. It was chaos. We needed something to standardize and automate.

**Interviewer:** How's that transformation going?

**Marcus:** The standardization part has been fantastic. All stores now follow the same workflows. But I'll be honest - the adoption has been slower than expected, especially with our less tech-savvy store managers.

**Interviewer:** What's causing the slow adoption?

**Marcus:** It's too much of a blank canvas. When I show a store manager StreamlineAI and say "build your inventory workflow," they freeze up. They don't know where to start. They're retail experts, not workflow designers.

**Interviewer:** How are you handling that currently?

**Marcus:** I've basically become a workflow consultant. I travel to stores, sit with managers, and build workflows with them. But that doesn't scale. We have 150 stores and I'm one person.

**Interviewer:** What would help solve this problem?

**Marcus:** Pre-built templates, 100%. Every retail store needs the same basic workflows - inventory counts, employee scheduling, customer complaints, supplier orders. If we had templates for those, managers could just customize them instead of starting from scratch.

**Interviewer:** Are there other challenges you're facing?

**Marcus:** Notifications are killing us. Everyone complains about getting too many. A store manager might get 50 notifications a day - workflow completed, approval needed, task assigned. Most of it isn't urgent but it all looks the same. People started ignoring notifications, which means they miss the important ones.

**Interviewer:** That sounds serious. Any specific examples?

**Marcus:** Last month, a freezer failure notification got buried in routine inventory alerts. The manager didn't see it for 6 hours. We lost $15,000 in product. That can't happen again.

**Interviewer:** How would you ideally want notifications to work?

**Marcus:** Smart prioritization. Critical stuff like equipment failures should blow up my phone. Routine completions can wait for a daily digest. And it should learn - if I always check inventory notifications at 9 AM, just batch them for then.

**Interviewer:** What else would improve your experience?

**Marcus:** Analytics that actually help me run the business. Right now I can see workflow metrics, but what I really need is business intelligence. Show me which stores are most efficient, where bottlenecks occur, which workflows save the most time. Give me insights I can act on.

**Interviewer:** Can you describe your ideal analytics dashboard?

**Marcus:** I want to log in and immediately see: store performance rankings, workflow optimization opportunities, and ROI metrics. Like "Store 42's inventory workflow is 30% slower than average - investigate step 3" or "Automating supplier orders saved 127 hours this month across all stores."

**Interviewer:** How does your team collaborate in StreamlineAI?

**Marcus:** That's another pain point actually. Workflows feel very siloed. If a store manager has a question about a workflow, they can't easily share it with me or get help from other managers. We end up using Slack for collaboration, which defeats the purpose.

**Interviewer:** What would better collaboration look like?

**Marcus:** Comments on workflows, ability to share best practices, maybe a library of workflows that high-performing stores could share with others. Create a community of practice within the platform.

**Interviewer:** Looking at ROI, how has StreamlineAI impacted your business?

**Marcus:** It's hard to quantify precisely because the platform doesn't surface those metrics. But my rough estimates: we've reduced process time by about 25%, fewer errors in orders and scheduling, better compliance with company standards. I think we're saving maybe $200K annually, but I need better data to prove it to my CFO.

**Interviewer:** If you could request three enhancements, what would they be?

**Marcus:** 
1. Industry-specific templates so stores can get value immediately
2. Intelligent notification system that actually helps rather than overwhelms
3. Business analytics that show ROI and optimization opportunities

**Interviewer:** Any features you don't use or find unnecessary?

**Marcus:** The advanced workflow logic options are overkill for us. We need simple, reliable workflows, not complex decision trees. Sometimes I feel like the platform is built for tech companies, not retailers.

**Interviewer:** Would you recommend StreamlineAI to other retailers?

**Marcus:** With the right improvements, absolutely. The core platform is solid. It just needs to be more accessible for non-technical users and provide better business insights. Fix those things and you'll own the retail automation market.

**Interviewer:** This is great feedback, Marcus. Anything else you'd like to add?

**Marcus:** Just that we're invested in making this work. StreamlineAI has huge potential for retail operations. We want to be part of shaping its future. Happy to beta test new features or provide more detailed feedback anytime.
