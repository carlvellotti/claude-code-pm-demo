## Interview Transcript

**Interviewer:** Dr. Rodriguez, thank you for your time. Can you tell us about MedCenter Health and how you use StreamlineAI?

**Dr. Rodriguez:** We're a network of 12 clinics serving about 50,000 patients. I'm responsible for operational efficiency across all locations. We implemented StreamlineAI six months ago for patient intake, appointment scheduling, and insurance verification workflows.

**Interviewer:** How has the implementation gone?

**Dr. Rodriguez:** It's been transformative for our back-office operations. Insurance verification used to take 45 minutes per patient, now it's down to 15. But we've hit some significant roadblocks that are limiting our full adoption.

**Interviewer:** What are the main roadblocks?

**Dr. Rodriguez:** Compliance and documentation. Healthcare has strict requirements about documenting every process, showing audit trails, proving HIPAA compliance. StreamlineAI does the work, but I can't easily prove to auditors what happened and when.

**Interviewer:** Can you give a specific example?

**Dr. Rodriguez:** Last month, we had a compliance audit. The auditor wanted to see the complete history of how we handled patient data in our verification workflow - who accessed what, when changes were made, approval chains. It took my team two days to manually compile this from various exports. That should be a one-click report.

**Interviewer:** What would ideal compliance features look like?

**Dr. Rodriguez:** Built-in audit reports that show the complete lifecycle of any workflow instance. HIPAA-compliant logging. Role-based access controls that I can easily demonstrate. Basically, make it so I can prove compliance without manual work.

**Interviewer:** Are there other healthcare-specific challenges?

**Dr. Rodriguez:** Integration with our EMR systems is painful. We use Epic at some locations, Cerner at others. Getting StreamlineAI to talk to these systems requires custom development every time. I wish there were pre-built healthcare integrations.

**Interviewer:** How does this impact your operations?

**Dr. Rodriguez:** Staff have to manually transfer data between systems. That's error-prone and time-consuming. We're automating workflows but still have manual data entry, which defeats half the purpose.

**Interviewer:** What about your clinical staff's experience?

**Dr. Rodriguez:** Honestly, most of them don't use it directly. The workflows are too complex to modify, and they don't have time to learn. My operations team builds everything, then trains clinical staff on just their piece. It works but it's not ideal.

**Interviewer:** What would help clinical staff engage more?

**Dr. Rodriguez:** Simple, role-specific interfaces. A nurse should see only nurse-relevant workflows, in terminology they understand. Maybe even voice inputs - they're often hands-full with patients.

**Interviewer:** How do you measure success currently?

**Dr. Rodriguez:** We track patient wait times, insurance approval rates, and staff hours saved. StreamlineAI gives us some of this data, but I have to combine it with EMR reports and manual tracking. I need unified healthcare KPIs.

**Interviewer:** What KPIs are most important?

**Dr. Rodriguez:** Patient satisfaction scores, compliance metrics, revenue cycle improvements, and staff utilization. I want to see how workflow improvements directly impact patient care and our bottom line.

**Interviewer:** Have you seen ROI from StreamlineAI?

**Dr. Rodriguez:** Definitely. We've reduced administrative staff overtime by 30% and improved insurance approval rates by 15%. But the compliance headaches and integration issues are holding us back from full value realization.

**Interviewer:** If you could add three features, what would they be?

**Dr. Rodriguez:**
1. Healthcare compliance suite - audit trails, HIPAA controls, one-click compliance reports
2. Pre-built EMR integrations for major systems
3. Healthcare workflow templates designed by people who understand medical operations

**Interviewer:** You mentioned templates - can you elaborate?

**Dr. Rodriguez:** Every clinic needs patient intake, appointment scheduling, prescription refills, lab result notifications. But these aren't generic business processes - they have specific healthcare requirements. Templates built by healthcare ops experts would save us months of development.

**Interviewer:** How does StreamlineAI compare to healthcare-specific solutions?

**Dr. Rodriguez:** Healthcare-specific platforms understand compliance but lack flexibility. StreamlineAI is flexible but requires us to build healthcare features ourselves. You're 70% there - just need that healthcare layer on top.

**Interviewer:** What about patient-facing features?

**Dr. Rodriguez:** That's interesting. Right now, StreamlineAI is all back-office. But if patients could track their appointment prep, submit forms, get reminders - that would be game-changing. Make it patient-centric, not just staff-centric.

**Interviewer:** Any concerns about StreamlineAI's future in healthcare?

**Dr. Rodriguez:** My biggest fear is you'll stay generic and we'll eventually have to switch to a healthcare-specific platform. But if you commit to healthcare features, we'd be customers for life. The core platform is excellent.

**Interviewer:** Any final thoughts?

**Dr. Rodriguez:** Healthcare is complex, but the opportunity is massive. Every clinic in America has these same problems. Solve them well, and you'll transform healthcare operations. We're happy to partner on that journey - beta testing, feature design, whatever you need.
