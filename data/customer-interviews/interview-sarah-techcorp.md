## Interview Transcript

**Interviewer:** Thanks for joining us today, Sarah. Can you tell us about your role and how you currently use StreamlineAI?

**Sarah:** Sure! I'm the Operations Director at TechCorp, been here for about 3 years. We've been using StreamlineAI for about 8 months now, primarily for our customer onboarding workflows and some internal approval processes.

**Interviewer:** How has your experience been so far?

**Sarah:** It's been mostly positive. The platform has definitely helped us standardize our processes. Before StreamlineAI, everything was manual - lots of emails, spreadsheets, things falling through the cracks. Now it's much more organized.

**Interviewer:** That's great to hear. What specific improvements have you seen?

**Sarah:** Our customer onboarding time went from 2 weeks to about 5 days. That's huge for us. The automated reminders and task assignments mean nothing gets forgotten anymore. We used to have customers waiting weeks for access because someone forgot to create their account.

**Interviewer:** Are there any challenges or frustrations you've encountered?

**Sarah:** Oh definitely. The biggest one is probably the mobile experience. Our field teams can't really use the platform when they're on-site. They have to either wait until they're back at the office or call someone to make changes for them. It's really inefficient.

**Interviewer:** Can you give me a specific example?

**Sarah:** Last week, one of our field techs was at a client site and realized the workflow we'd set up wasn't quite right for their specific setup. He had to call me, explain the issue over the phone, and then I had to make the changes from my laptop. It took 30 minutes for something that should have taken 5.

**Interviewer:** That does sound frustrating. Are there other pain points?

**Sarah:** The learning curve for new employees is pretty steep. We've hired 5 new people in the last quarter, and it takes them at least a month to get comfortable with creating workflows. I wish there were templates or something to help them get started faster.

**Interviewer:** Tell me more about that.

**Sarah:** Well, when someone new joins, I have to sit with them for hours showing them how to build basic workflows. And honestly, 80% of what we do follows similar patterns. Like, approval workflows all have the same basic structure - submit, review, approve or reject, notify. But everyone has to build it from scratch every time.

**Interviewer:** Have you looked at any alternatives or competitor products?

**Sarah:** We evaluated WorkflowMax and Zapier Enterprise. WorkflowMax has really nice templates but their integration options are limited. Zapier is powerful but almost too complex for our team. StreamlineAI hits a nice middle ground, it just needs those quality of life improvements.

**Interviewer:** If you could wave a magic wand and add three features to StreamlineAI, what would they be?

**Sarah:** Easy - mobile app, workflow templates, and better analytics. Oh, and if I get a fourth wish, some kind of AI assistant that could suggest improvements to our workflows. We're probably not using the platform as efficiently as we could be.

**Interviewer:** Can you elaborate on the analytics piece?

**Sarah:** Right now I can see basic metrics like completion rates and time to complete. But I want to know things like: which steps take the longest? Where do workflows get stuck? Are there patterns in the workflows that fail? I need insights, not just data.

**Interviewer:** How do you measure success with StreamlineAI currently?

**Sarah:** Honestly, it's pretty manual. I export data to Excel and create my own reports. I track things like how many workflows we complete per week, average completion time, and error rates. But it takes me hours every month to pull this together.

**Interviewer:** What's the impact of these limitations on your business?

**Sarah:** The mobile issue alone probably costs us 10-15 hours per week in inefficiency. The lack of templates means new hires aren't fully productive for a month instead of a week. And without good analytics, I'm probably missing opportunities to optimize. I'd estimate we're leaving 20-30% productivity gains on the table.

**Interviewer:** How does your team feel about the platform?

**Sarah:** It's mixed. The office teams love it - huge improvement over our old manual processes. The field teams tolerate it but are frustrated by the mobile limitations. New employees find it overwhelming at first but appreciate it once they're trained.

**Interviewer:** Any final thoughts or feedback?

**Sarah:** Overall, StreamlineAI has been good for us. It's solved our biggest pain points around process standardization and automation. But to really unlock its full potential, we need those mobile capabilities and better onboarding tools. Fix those, and this would be a game-changer for companies like ours.

**Interviewer:** This has been incredibly helpful, Sarah. Thank you so much for your time and insights.

**Sarah:** Happy to help! I'm excited to see where the platform goes. Feel free to reach out if you need any clarification or have follow-up questions.
