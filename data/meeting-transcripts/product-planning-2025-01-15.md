Sarah: Alright everyone lets review our Q1 priorities based on customer feedback. Lisa want to start with what youre hearing?

Lisa: Sure. The overwhelming theme is onboarding complexity. Im spending three to four hours per new customer just getting them to their first workflow. Customers keep asking for templates or some kind of quick start.

David: Im losing deals because of this. Prospects see the demo and love it but when they hear about the forty five day implementation timeline they balk. CompetitorX is promising one week implementations with their templates.

Marcus: From an engineering perspective building a template system isnt trivial. We need versioning customization capabilities validation. Id estimate two to three sprints minimum.

Jessica: Ive actually been sketching some ideas. What if we start simple just five templates for the most common use cases? We could launch MVP in one sprint.

Sarah: I like that approach. Lisa what would your top five templates be?

Lisa: Based on support data. Employee onboarding. Expense approvals. Customer feedback collection. Inventory management. Document approvals. These cover about sixty percent of initial workflows created.

Marcus: If we limit to those five and keep customization basic we could do it in one sprint. But no fancy features just pre populated workflows they can modify.

Sarah: Lets do it. Marcus can your team handle that in Sprint twenty three?

Marcus: If Jessica gets us designs by end of this week yes.

Jessica: Ill have wireframes by Thursday full designs by Monday.

David: This would be huge for sales. Can we also create a template marketplace eventually? Let customers share their workflows?

Sarah: Good idea for phase two. Lets focus on these five first. What else is critical for Q1?

Lisa: Mobile access. I have at least ten customers threatening to churn because field workers cant use the platform.

Marcus: Thats a bigger effort. Full mobile app would be three to four months minimum.

Jessica: What about a progressive web app? We could get basic workflow viewing and editing in six weeks.

Marcus: Hmm if we limit features just view edit and complete workflows PWA could work. No workflow creation on mobile initially.

Sarah: Lets pursue that. Basic mobile access is better than none. David would that help with the field service deals?

David: Absolutely. Even read only would help but light editing is the sweet spot.

Sarah: OK so our Q1 priorities. Five basic templates Sprint twenty three. PWA for mobile Sprints twenty four to twenty six. What else is critical?

Lisa: Better analytics. Customers cant prove ROI to their bosses. They need dashboards showing time saved efficiency gains etc.

Marcus: We have all that data just not surfaced well. Thats mostly frontend work.

Jessica: I could design a simple analytics dashboard in parallel with the other work. Maybe two sprints?

Sarah: Lets add that to Sprint twenty five to twenty six after templates launch. Any other critical items?

David: Slack integration. Every prospect asks about it.

Marcus: Thats actually easy maybe one sprint. We can use their workflow builder API.

Sarah: Great lets add that to Sprint twenty four. So our Q1 roadmap Sprint twenty three template system five templates. Sprint twenty four Slack integration. Sprints twenty four to twenty six mobile PWA. Sprints twenty five to twenty six analytics dashboard.

Lisa: This would address eighty percent of my escalations. Excited to see it happen.

David: Same here. This roadmap would unblock about two million dollars in pipeline.

Marcus: Aggressive but doable if we dont scope creep. Sarah can you lock down requirements?

Sarah: Ill have PRDs for templates and mobile by end of week. Jessica lets sync tomorrow on design priorities.

Jessica: Sounds good. Ill start on template wireframes today.

Sarah: Great meeting everyone. Lets check in again next week on progress. I need to write PRD for template system by Friday. Write PRD for mobile PWA by Friday. Schedule design sync with Jessica for tomorrow. Lock down requirements to prevent scope creep.

Jessica: Ill create template wireframes by Thursday. Complete template designs by Monday. Start mobile PWA design research.

Marcus: Ill estimate technical effort for Slack integration. Identify engineers for template project. Research PWA frameworks and constraints.

Lisa: Ill provide detailed template requirements based on customer data. Identify beta customers for template testing. Document common customizations needed.

David: Ill create sales collateral for template system. Identify prospects waiting for mobile access. Quantify revenue impact of Q1 roadmap.

Sarah: Follow up meeting January twenty second to review progress.
