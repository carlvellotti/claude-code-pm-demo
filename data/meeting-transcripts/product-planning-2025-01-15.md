# Product Planning Meeting
**Date:** January 15, 2025  
**Attendees:** Sarah (PM), Marcus (Eng Lead), Jessica (Design), David (Sales), Lisa (Customer Success)  
**Duration:** 60 minutes

## Meeting Notes

**Sarah:** Alright everyone, let's review our Q1 priorities based on customer feedback. Lisa, want to start with what you're hearing?

**Lisa:** Sure. The overwhelming theme is onboarding complexity. I'm spending 3-4 hours per new customer just getting them to their first workflow. Customers keep asking for templates or some kind of quick start.

**David:** I'm losing deals because of this. Prospects see the demo and love it, but when they hear about the 45-day implementation timeline, they balk. CompetitorX is promising 1-week implementations with their templates.

**Marcus:** From an engineering perspective, building a template system isn't trivial. We need versioning, customization capabilities, validation. I'd estimate 2-3 sprints minimum.

**Jessica:** I've actually been sketching some ideas. What if we start simple - just 5 templates for the most common use cases? We could launch MVP in one sprint.

**Sarah:** I like that approach. Lisa, what would your top 5 templates be?

**Lisa:** Based on support data:
1. Employee onboarding
2. Expense approvals  
3. Customer feedback collection
4. Inventory management
5. Document approvals

These cover about 60% of initial workflows created.

**Marcus:** If we limit to those 5, and keep customization basic, we could do it in one sprint. But no fancy features - just pre-populated workflows they can modify.

**Sarah:** Let's do it. Marcus, can your team handle that in Sprint 23?

**Marcus:** If Jessica gets us designs by end of this week, yes.

**Jessica:** I'll have wireframes by Thursday, full designs by Monday.

**David:** This would be huge for sales. Can we also create a template marketplace eventually? Let customers share their workflows?

**Sarah:** Good idea for phase 2. Let's focus on these 5 first. What else is critical for Q1?

**Lisa:** Mobile access. I have at least 10 customers threatening to churn because field workers can't use the platform. 

**Marcus:** That's a bigger effort. Full mobile app would be 3-4 months minimum.

**Jessica:** What about a progressive web app? We could get basic workflow viewing and editing in 6 weeks.

**Marcus:** Hmm, if we limit features - just view, edit, and complete workflows - PWA could work. No workflow creation on mobile initially.

**Sarah:** Let's pursue that. Basic mobile access is better than none. David, would that help with the field service deals?

**David:** Absolutely. Even read-only would help, but light editing is the sweet spot.

**Sarah:** Ok, so our Q1 priorities:
1. 5 basic templates - Sprint 23
2. PWA for mobile - Sprints 24-26
3. What else is critical?

**Lisa:** Better analytics. Customers can't prove ROI to their bosses. They need dashboards showing time saved, efficiency gains, etc.

**Marcus:** We have all that data, just not surfaced well. That's mostly frontend work.

**Jessica:** I could design a simple analytics dashboard in parallel with the other work. Maybe 2 sprints?

**Sarah:** Let's add that to Sprint 25-26, after templates launch. Any other critical items?

**David:** Slack integration. Every prospect asks about it.

**Marcus:** That's actually easy - maybe 1 sprint. We can use their workflow builder API.

**Sarah:** Great, let's add that to Sprint 24. So our Q1 roadmap:
- Sprint 23: Template system (5 templates)
- Sprint 24: Slack integration
- Sprints 24-26: Mobile PWA
- Sprints 25-26: Analytics dashboard

**Lisa:** This would address 80% of my escalations. Excited to see it happen.

**David:** Same here. This roadmap would unblock about $2M in pipeline.

**Marcus:** Aggressive but doable if we don't scope creep. Sarah, can you lock down requirements?

**Sarah:** I'll have PRDs for templates and mobile by end of week. Jessica, let's sync tomorrow on design priorities.

**Jessica:** Sounds good. I'll start on template wireframes today.

**Sarah:** Great meeting everyone. Let's check in again next week on progress.

## Action Items

**Sarah:**
- [ ] Write PRD for template system by Friday
- [ ] Write PRD for mobile PWA by Friday  
- [ ] Schedule design sync with Jessica for tomorrow
- [ ] Lock down requirements to prevent scope creep

**Jessica:**
- [ ] Create template wireframes by Thursday
- [ ] Complete template designs by Monday
- [ ] Start mobile PWA design research

**Marcus:**
- [ ] Estimate technical effort for Slack integration
- [ ] Identify engineers for template project
- [ ] Research PWA frameworks and constraints

**Lisa:**
- [ ] Provide detailed template requirements based on customer data
- [ ] Identify beta customers for template testing
- [ ] Document common customizations needed

**David:**
- [ ] Create sales collateral for template system
- [ ] Identify prospects waiting for mobile access
- [ ] Quantify revenue impact of Q1 roadmap

## Key Decisions
1. Start with 5 basic templates vs comprehensive system
2. Build PWA instead of native mobile apps
3. Prioritize templates over analytics for faster impact
4. Add Slack integration to Q1 based on sales feedback

## Follow-up Meeting
- Scheduled for January 22 to review progress
- Jessica to present template designs
- Marcus to share technical approach
