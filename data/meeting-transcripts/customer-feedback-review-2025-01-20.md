# Customer Feedback Review Meeting
**Date:** January 20, 2025  
**Attendees:** Lisa (Customer Success Lead), Sarah (PM), Tom (Support Manager), Rachel (UX Research)  
**Duration:** 45 minutes

## Meeting Notes

**Lisa:** Thanks for joining. I wanted to review the feedback from our Q4 customer survey and support tickets. Tom, want to start with support trends?

**Tom:** Sure. Looking at our data, top issues by volume:
1. "How do I..." questions - 45% of tickets
2. Notification overload complaints - 22%
3. Integration errors - 18%
4. Performance issues - 10%
5. Feature requests - 5%

**Sarah:** That "how do I" percentage is concerning. What are they asking about?

**Tom:** Mostly basic stuff - creating workflows, setting up approvals, connecting integrations. Things that should be intuitive. My team spends half their time on user education.

**Rachel:** This aligns with our usability tests. New users take average 47 minutes to create their first workflow. Industry standard is under 15 minutes.

**Lisa:** And that's costing us. January churned customers cited "too complex" as primary reason. We lost $340K in ARR.

**Sarah:** Ouch. What about the notification issues?

**Tom:** Users get bombarded. One customer showed me their inbox - 73 StreamlineAI notifications in one day. They've started filtering them to spam.

**Rachel:** In user interviews, people want intelligent notifications. Quote from user: "Tell me what matters, not everything that happens."

**Lisa:** I have a great example. Remember the frozen foods incident at RetailFlow? Critical alert buried in routine notifications. Cost them $15K.

**Sarah:** We need to fix that ASAP. What are users asking for?

**Tom:** Smart grouping, priority levels, customizable channels. Basically, don't treat all notifications equally.

**Rachel:** Also time-based delivery. Users want summaries at convenient times, not constant interruptions.

**Lisa:** Moving to integrations - what are the main issues?

**Tom:** Authentication timeouts are the big one. Users set up an integration, it works for a week, then breaks when tokens expire. They don't understand why.

**Sarah:** That's a technical fix. I'll talk to Marcus. What about performance?

**Tom:** Mostly affects larger customers. Workflows with 50+ steps take 30+ seconds to load. One enterprise customer has workflows timing out completely.

**Rachel:** Performance perception is also hurt by lack of progress indicators. Users think system is frozen when it's actually processing.

**Lisa:** Let's talk about positive feedback too. What are customers loving?

**Tom:** The automation itself is life-changing for many. Quote: "I got 10 hours of my week back." Also, reliability - when workflows run, they run perfectly.

**Rachel:** Visual workflow builder gets consistent praise. Users love dragging and dropping vs coding.

**Lisa:** Sales enablement features are huge wins. Automated quote generation saved one customer 50 hours last month alone.

**Sarah:** Good to hear. So if we fix onboarding, notifications, and performance, we'd address what percentage of issues?

**Tom:** Roughly 75% of support tickets. Would dramatically reduce my team's workload.

**Lisa:** And likely cut churn in half. These aren't feature gaps - they're experience gaps.

**Rachel:** Exactly. The product capability is there. We need to make it accessible and manageable.

**Sarah:** What quick wins could we implement while working on bigger fixes?

**Tom:** Better in-app help. Even just tooltips on common actions would cut "how to" tickets by 20%.

**Rachel:** Onboarding checklist. Show new users exactly what to do first, second, third. Guide the experience.

**Lisa:** And notification preferences. Even basic on/off toggles by notification type would help.

**Sarah:** All good ideas. Let's prioritize. What would have the biggest customer impact?

**Lisa:** Templates for quick start. If users could see value in 5 minutes instead of 45, that changes everything.

**Tom:** Agreed. Then notification intelligence, then performance optimization.

**Rachel:** Don't forget mobile. It wasn't in top 5 issues because people have given up asking.

**Lisa:** True. 40% of our addressable market can't use our product effectively.

**Sarah:** Ok, I'm hearing:
1. Templates/Quick start (onboarding)
2. Notification intelligence  
3. Mobile access
4. Performance optimization
5. Better help/guidance

Does that match your priority order?

**All:** Yes, that's right.

**Sarah:** Great. I'll create roadmap proposals for each. What else should I know?

**Lisa:** Competition is heating up. Three customers mentioned evaluating alternatives due to these exact issues.

**Tom:** Support team morale is low from answering the same questions repeatedly. Better product experience would help retention - both customers and employees.

**Rachel:** Consider progressive disclosure. Don't show advanced features until users master basics.

**Sarah:** All valuable input. Let's meet again after I draft the roadmaps. Thanks everyone.
