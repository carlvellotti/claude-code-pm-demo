Lisa: Thanks for joining everyone. I wanted to review the feedback from our Q4 customer survey and support tickets. Tom want to start with support trends?

Tom: Sure looking at our data top issues by volume. Forty five percent how do I questions. Twenty two percent notification overload complaints. Eighteen percent integration errors. Ten percent performance issues. Five percent feature requests.

Sarah: That how do I percentage is concerning. What are they asking about?

Tom: Mostly basic stuff creating workflows setting up approvals connecting integrations. Things that should be intuitive. My team spends half their time on user education.

Rachel: This aligns with our usability tests. New users take average forty seven minutes to create their first workflow. Industry standard is under fifteen minutes.

Lisa: And thats costing us. January churned customers cited too complex as primary reason. We lost three hundred forty K in ARR.

Sarah: Ouch. What about the notification issues?

Tom: Users get bombarded. One customer showed me their inbox seventy three StreamlineAI notifications in one day. Theyve started filtering them to spam.

Rachel: In user interviews people want intelligent notifications. Quote from user tell me what matters not everything that happens.

Lisa: I have a great example. Remember the frozen foods incident at RetailFlow? Critical alert buried in routine notifications. Cost them fifteen K.

Sarah: We need to fix that ASAP. What are users asking for?

Tom: Smart grouping priority levels customizable channels. Basically dont treat all notifications equally.

Rachel: Also time based delivery. Users want summaries at convenient times not constant interruptions.

Lisa: Moving to integrations what are the main issues?

Tom: Authentication timeouts are the big one. Users set up an integration it works for a week then breaks when tokens expire. They dont understand why.

Sarah: Thats a technical fix. Ill talk to Marcus. What about performance?

Tom: Mostly affects larger customers. Workflows with fifty plus steps take thirty plus seconds to load. One enterprise customer has workflows timing out completely.

Rachel: Performance perception is also hurt by lack of progress indicators. Users think system is frozen when its actually processing.

Lisa: Lets talk about positive feedback too. What are customers loving?

Tom: The automation itself is life changing for many. Quote I got ten hours of my week back. Also reliability when workflows run they run perfectly.

Rachel: Visual workflow builder gets consistent praise. Users love dragging and dropping versus coding.

Lisa: Sales enablement features are huge wins. Automated quote generation saved one customer fifty hours last month alone.

Sarah: Good to hear. So if we fix onboarding notifications and performance wed address what percentage of issues?

Tom: Roughly seventy five percent of support tickets. Would dramatically reduce my teams workload.

Lisa: And likely cut churn in half. These arent feature gaps theyre experience gaps.

Rachel: Exactly. The product capability is there. We need to make it accessible and manageable.

Sarah: What quick wins could we implement while working on bigger fixes?

Tom: Better in app help. Even just tooltips on common actions would cut how to tickets by twenty percent.

Rachel: Onboarding checklist. Show new users exactly what to do first second third. Guide the experience.

Lisa: And notification preferences. Even basic on off toggles by notification type would help.

Sarah: All good ideas. Lets prioritize. What would have the biggest customer impact?

Lisa: Templates for quick start. If users could see value in five minutes instead of forty five that changes everything.

Tom: Agreed. Then notification intelligence then performance optimization.

Rachel: Dont forget mobile. It wasnt in top five issues because people have given up asking.

Lisa: True. Forty percent of our addressable market cant use our product effectively.

Sarah: OK Im hearing templates quick start onboarding. Notification intelligence. Mobile access. Performance optimization. Better help guidance. Does that match your priority order?

Lisa: Yes thats right.

Tom: Agreed.

Rachel: Yep.

Sarah: Great. Ill create roadmap proposals for each. What else should I know?

Lisa: Competition is heating up. Three customers mentioned evaluating alternatives due to these exact issues.

Tom: Support team morale is low from answering the same questions repeatedly. Better product experience would help retention both customers and employees.

Rachel: Consider progressive disclosure. Dont show advanced features until users master basics.

Sarah: All valuable input. Lets meet again after I draft the roadmaps. I need to create roadmap proposals for top five issues. Share notification intelligence spec with team. Schedule follow up on template implementation. Talk to Marcus about auth timeout fixes.

Lisa: Ill identify at risk customers for beta testing. Quantify revenue impact of each improvement. Create customer advisory board for feedback.

Tom: Ill document most common how to questions. Create knowledge base articles for quick wins. Train team on upcoming changes.

Rachel: Ill design onboarding checklist mockup. Run usability test on template concept. Create notification preference wireframes.

Sarah: Thanks everyone. Next meeting January twenty seventh for roadmap review.
