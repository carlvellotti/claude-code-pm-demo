# Create Internal Release Announcement

You are crafting an internal release announcement to get the team excited about new features or improvements. Follow this approach:

1. **Gather Context**:
   - What features/fixes are included
   - Who is impacted (which teams/customers)
   - What problem this solves
   - Key metrics or expected outcomes

2. **Announcement Structure**:

```markdown
# ðŸš€ [Release Name] is Live!

**TL;DR:** [One sentence summary of what shipped and why it matters]

## What's New
[2-3 bullet points of key features/improvements, focusing on user benefit]

## Why This Matters
[1-2 paragraphs connecting to company goals and customer value]

## By The Numbers
- [Metric 1]: [Impact]
- [Metric 2]: [Impact]
- [Time/effort saved]: [Amount]

## Who To Thank
[Recognize team members who contributed]

## What's Next
[Upcoming related work or iterations]

## Get Involved
- Try it out: [Link or instructions]
- Share feedback: [Channel or person]
- Learn more: [Documentation link]
```

3. **Channel-Specific Versions**:
   
   **Slack (short):**
   ```
   ðŸš€ [Feature] is live! [Key benefit in 1 sentence]
   [Link to try it] | [Link to learn more]
   ```
   
   **Email (medium):**
   - Subject: "[Release Name] Ships! [Key Benefit]"
   - 3-4 paragraphs with links
   
4. **Tone Guidelines**:
   - Celebratory but professional
   - Focus on customer/user impact
   - Give credit generously
   - Make it easy to take action

5. **Save Outputs**:
   - Full announcement: `/announcements/[date]-[release]-announcement.md`
   - Slack version: `/announcements/[date]-[release]-slack.txt`
   - Note which channels to post to

Remember: Internal announcements build momentum and recognition. Make people proud of what we shipped!
