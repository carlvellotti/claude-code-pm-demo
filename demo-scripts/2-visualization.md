# Demo Script 2: Visualizing Files - IDE vs Obsidian

## Overview
Demonstrate how different tools can visualize and work with the files Claude Code creates, emphasizing the right tool for the right job.

## Part 1: Setting the Context (1 min)

### Opening Statement
"Claude Code works with files on your system, which means you can use your favorite tools to view and edit them. Let me show you two different approaches."

### Key Message
"The beauty is you're not locked into any specific tool - use what works best for your workflow."

## Part 2: Obsidian for Text Work (3 min)

### Setup
- Open Obsidian with the PG Demo folder as vault
- Show the folder structure in sidebar

### Demonstration Points

1. **Graph View**
   - "Look how Obsidian shows relationships between our documents"
   - Navigate between PRDs, meeting notes, and interviews
   - "Perfect for PMs who need to see connections"

2. **Markdown Preview**
   - Open a PRD in Obsidian
   - "Beautiful rendering of our documents"
   - Show split view with edit and preview

3. **Search and Tags**
   - Search for "mobile" across all documents
   - "Instant search across all your product docs"
   - Show how tags create automatic organization

4. **Daily Notes Integration**
   - "Many PMs use daily notes for standups"
   - Show how Claude's outputs integrate with existing notes

### Talking Points
- "Obsidian is perfect for product managers and writers"
- "See your documentation as a connected knowledge base"
- "Great for non-technical team members"

## Part 3: IDE for Technical Work (3 min)

### Setup
- Open VS Code (or Cursor) with PG Demo folder
- Show file explorer panel

### Demonstration Points

1. **File Tree View**
   - "Developers prefer this hierarchical view"
   - Expand folders to show organization
   - "Easy to see project structure at a glance"

2. **Multi-File Editing**
   - Open 3 PRDs in tabs
   - "Compare different PRDs side by side"
   - Show split panel editing

3. **Integrated Terminal**
   - Show Claude Code running in terminal
   - "Developers can run Claude without leaving their IDE"
   - Demo running a command while viewing files

4. **Search and Replace**
   - Search for "StreamlineAI" across all files
   - "Powerful search with regex support"
   - "Great for updating terms across all docs"

### IDE-Specific Benefits
- Syntax highlighting for code blocks
- Git integration for version control
- Extensions for additional functionality

## Part 4: Choosing the Right Tool (2 min)

### Comparison Table

| Use Case | Obsidian | IDE |
|----------|----------|-----|
| Writing PRDs | ✅ Better | ✓ Good |
| Reviewing meeting notes | ✅ Better | ✓ Good |
| Knowledge management | ✅ Better | ❌ Limited |
| Code documentation | ✓ Good | ✅ Better |
| Multi-file operations | ✓ Good | ✅ Better |
| Team collaboration | ✅ Better | ✓ Good |

### Workflow Example
"Here's how I use both:
1. Morning: Open Obsidian for daily planning and reviewing notes
2. Working session: Use IDE when actively working with Claude Code
3. Documentation: Switch to Obsidian for writing and connecting ideas"

## Part 5: Live Tool Switching (1 min)

### Quick Demo
1. Make an edit in Obsidian
2. Show it immediately in VS Code
3. Have Claude read the change

"See? Same files, different views. Use what makes you productive."

## Key Messages

1. **Tool Flexibility**: "Claude Code doesn't lock you into any specific editor"

2. **Right Tool for Job**: "Obsidian for knowledge work, IDEs for technical work"

3. **Seamless Integration**: "Changes in any tool are immediately available to Claude"

4. **Team Friendly**: "Different team members can use different tools on same files"

## Common Questions

**Q: "Do I need to install both?"**
A: "No, pick what suits your work style. Many PMs love Obsidian, developers prefer IDEs."

**Q: "What about Google Docs or Notion?"**
A: "Claude works with local files, but we'll show MCPs later that can integrate with cloud tools."

**Q: "Can Claude create Obsidian-specific features like linked mentions?"**
A: "Yes! Just ask Claude to use [[wiki-links]] or #tags in documents."

## Troubleshooting

If Obsidian doesn't show files:
- Check vault location is correct
- Refresh the file explorer
- Ensure .md extension on files

If IDE seems overwhelming:
- Focus on just file explorer and editor
- Mention simpler alternatives like Typora
- Emphasize they don't need all features
